# Marks2CSV

## Introduction

Marks2CSV is an innovative tool designed to automate the process of 
converting student marks from answer sheet tables into well-structured 
CSV files. This utility is particularly useful for educators of [SJCET, Palai](https://sjcetpalai.ac.in)
who handle multiple student answer sheets and need to systematically 
record marks for further assessment and analysis.

## Why Marks2CSV?

Traditionally, marks from internal exams are recorded on the front of
each student's answer sheet, with individual question scores noted. 
Educators are then tasked with the laborious job of transcribing these 
marks into a CSV file format that adheres to specific requirements for 
further mapping to Course Outcomes (COs). This manual process is not 
only time-consuming but also prone to errors.

Marks2CSV simplifies this process. For a class of 60 students, instead 
of manually typing each student's marks into a spreadsheet, educators 
can now ease this process by just providing pictures of front of answer
sheet to the system and Marks2CSV will do the rest.

## Process Workflow

1. **Receives the Captured Image**: Begin by capturing an image of the entire answer sheet.

2. **Crop and Warp Image**: The image is then cropped and warped to focus only on the answer sheet section.

3. **Extract Table Containing Marks**: From the warped image, extract the table that contains the marks.

4. **Crop Out Each Cell of the Table**: Isolate each cell within the table for further processing.

5. **Text Recognition**: Each cropped cell is fed into the model for text recognition to detect the marks written inside.

6. **Map the Predicted Marks**: Convert the recognized marks of current answer sheet into the required CSV format.

7. **Repeat for Other Students**: This entire process is repeated for each student's answer sheet.
