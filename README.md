# Marks2CSV

## Introduction

Marks2CSV is an innovative tool designed to automate the process of 
converting student marks from answer sheet tables into well-structured 
CSV files. This utility is particularly useful for educators of [SJCET, Palai](https://sjcetpalai.ac.in)
who handle multiple student answer sheets and need to systematically 
record marks for further assessment and analysis.
